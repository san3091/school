# Oedipal Stabilization in Joyce's *Ulysses* and Sterne's *Tristram Shandy*

##Ten Years After _Ulysses_

​		The triangle Stephen-Bloom-Molly in James Joyce’s *Ulysses* establishes a modernist holy family, the secular equivalent of Jesus-Joseph-Mary, itself a version of what Freud theorized as the Oedipal family, (Father-Mother-Son) a structure deeply embedded in western, patriarchal culture. Whether Joyce's allusion to this triangulation is a reworking of it into a modern secular context, or rather an invocation in order to critique and complicate it, has been a subject of dispute. In this paper I will argue that *Ulysses* was written by James Joyce as Stephen’s reflection and commentary on Oedipal triangulation as a mode of being in the world. This commentary is achieved by implying an authorial Stephen, writing the events of June 16th, 1904,  ten years after they happened, that is, at the brink of the Great War. The almost obsessive detail included in *Ulysses* becomes a reaching to the past, a kind of preserving under a bell jar for display a world that is on the verge of disappearing. This reading infuses Ulysses with Kairos and contradicts the reading of *Ulysses* as any day in anyman’s life, and rather establishes its status as a mythical text, in Eliade’s sense of the word. *Ulysses* becomes Stephen Dedalus’ mythologizing a structure that, he fears, will no longer be a way to establish oneself in society, and in the world, with stability. 

​	The evidence for this reading is most evident in the Proteus episode, where Stephen desires to be drawn into an Oedipal triangle, and thus stabilized and normalized, i.e. reestablished as normal—the son who longs for the mother he can’t have due to the incest taboo, and so learns from his father to go out into the world to find a mother-replacement, which will in turn spawn a new Oedipal triangle, and so *ad infinitum,* like a vicious viral infection, spreading a stable and silencing civilization to every corner of the globe. In the evident representation of this desire, and Stephen’s eventual rejection of the possibility of being *actually* drawn into an Oedipal triangle, I read Stephen the author’s commentary, and preservation for admiration, as a story *in illo tempore* of Oedipal structures.

## Stephen Normalized

​	Stephen Dedalus has been read by scholars, most notably by John Paul Riquelme, as the implied author of *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* and *Ulysses.* Although a reading of Stephen as a stand-in for Joyce himself is possible, Riquelme suggests that, although “strong evidence supports this kind of […] reading,” “an autobiographical interpretation of a different sort is also possible, one that sees Stephen Dedalus as the teller of his own story” (368). This reading ascertains that “the large problem of [Stephen’s] future as an artist can no longer be at issue,” since the product of his artistic struggle sits between the reader’s hands, it merely displaces the Stephen-Joyce relation to another realm, i.e., from the textual-real to the metatextual-real. This reading introduces a new relation to take into account when reading the texts, that of Stephen the character and Stephen the author. Stephen the author of *Ulysses* is now outside the text, and the text we hold in our hands is the product of the coming-of-age in *Portrait*. 

​	What happens, then, with the fact that James Joyce wrote both texts? The function of Stephen as the implied author becomes deliberate, his presence a part of the narrative, regardless of its biographical resonances and allusions. It plays a structural role in understanding what they dramatize. If Stephen as implied author was written in by Joyce, then the relationship between Stephen the character and Stephen the author must be taken into account in any reading of the texts.

​	Through a reading of *Ulysses* and *Portrait* from this framework, I seek to explore narrative as self-creation. I read *Ulysses* as a dramatization of a subject engaging in creative production in order to stabilize and legitimize an identity. What I’m most interested in is all the ways in which this project fails. In order to discover the nuances of how it fails I turn to Deleuze and Guattari’s *Anti-Oedipus*. First, their insight of the Oedipal as a repression of desiring-production, seeking to stabilize it will shed light on the relation between Stephen and his text itself. Second, their analysis of the Oedipal “reducing a person […] to a pitiful creature who eternally consumes daddy-and-mommy and nothing else whatsoever” (21) sheds light on the content of the text itself—it’s focus on himself, then on Leopold Bloom, and finally on Molly Bloom.

​	To image the relation between Joyce and Stephen, Joseph Valente proposes the difference between “relation and representation” (424). Parting from Basil’s assertion that “It is not [the sitter] who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who … reveals himself” (Wilde qtd Valente 423) in *The Picture of Dorian Gray,* and Joyce’s interest in the subject as sitter of a *Portrait*, Valente explains that 

> Stephen must, therefore, not only be seen as Joyce and not Joyce, but he must also be seen as revealing Joyce precisely to the extent that he is *not* a self depiction (being instead a portrait painted with feeling) and disfiguring Joyce to the extent that he is a self-depiction, altered by this feeling” (Valente 423-4).

Then, comparing Wilde and Joyce on portraiture, he concludes that

> the “feeling” that makes Dorian’s portrait “a portrait of the artist” involves Basil’s homoerotic attraction to his “sitter,” as Joyce recognizes, Joyce’s “feeling” for his “sitter” could only be constructed as narcissistic, a modality of desire properly understood as the precondition for any object relation, homo- or hetero-” (424). 

​	This relation of painter and sitter can then be extended beyond the autobiographical limits of the Joyce/Stephen relation, and onto the relation of Stephen the character and Stephen the author. Stephen as the author of both *Portrait* and *Ulysses* writes himself as his “sitter,” the portrait of which he is “paint[ing] with feeling,” necessarily “constructed as narcissistic.” The Stephen shown in the text, by way of Joyce’s intimation of an authorial Stephen, should not be read as a complete and faithful reproduction of Stephen the author, any more than we should read Stephen to be related in any way to Joyce. Rather, this ambiguity introduces a commentary of Stephen’s construction of an artistic identity through writing, recollection and recording, that is, through portraiture.





NOTES



Molly Bloom’s monologue is told in first person, stream of consciousness-style. This is the ultimate Oedipal masquerade of posessing the object of desire by becoming it. Stephen the author *becomes* Molly Bloom, her narrative mother. She is depicted as insepparable from her sexuality and her body, her menstrual blood.

But then this reading is quickly destabilized by Deleuze and Guattari’s insight that any process of production (writing) is also itself a production of production. The text itself is shaping Stephen, and will shape itself and then readers. It is, at the same time, a proces of registration (*enregistrement*) which locates Molly Bloom in her body, in her time, but refuses to locate her spatially.
